# Code Style Guide

This file collects the code style guidelines for the project. It is a work in progress and will be updated as needed.

# Imports

Newly created components should not have an _index.ts_ file. The component class should be imported directly from the _component.ts_ file. When working on components that still have an _index.ts_ file, it should be removed and the imports should be resolved.
